                    Since \(17\) is a Fermat prime, the regular heptadecagon is a constructible polygon, meaning it can be constructed using only a compass and an unmarked straightedge. <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 110, 0.8); padding:1px;">This remarkable result was demonstrated by Carl Friedrich Gauss in \(1796\) at the age of \(18\).</span> His proof marked the first significant advancement in the construction of regular polygons in over \(2000\) years.

        <h4>A fine description of Gauss by two of his students</h4>
        <div class="quote">
            He typically sat in a relaxed posture, slightly stooped, gazing downward with his hands folded above his lap. He spoke freely, clearly, and in a straightforward manner. However, when he wished to emphasize a new perspective, he would lift his head, turn to someone nearby, and fix them with his striking, penetrating blue eyes as he delivered his point.

        <div class="quote">
            From the early 1800s, Gauss showed interest in non-Euclidean geometry, discussing it with Farkas Bolyai and others. While hinting at its existence in an 1816 review, he avoided public admission, fearing it might harm his reputation.
