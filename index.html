                    Abel had planned to travel with Crelle to Paris, stopping in GÃ¶ttingen to visit Gauss. However, upon hearing that Gauss was not pleased with his work on the insolubility of the quintic, Abel decided not to visit Gauss. <u>Notably, Gauss never read Abel's paper, which was found <b>unopened</b> after his death.</u>

        <h4>Gauss's Perspective on Algebraic Solutions</h4>
        <div class="quote">
            Gauss's views on the algebraic solution of an equation were evident from his 1801 thesis, where he remarked that such a solution was no more meaningful than inventing a symbol for the root and declaring the equation's root to be equal to that symbol.

        <h4>Oystein Ore's Account of Niels Henrik Abel's Final Days</h4>
        <div class="quote">
            Abel's weakness and cough worsened, confining him to bed except for brief moments while it was made. Though he occasionally tried to work on mathematics, he was too weak to write. He often reflected on his poverty and Fru Hansteen's kindness, remaining kind and patient throughout. On the night of April 5, he endured severe agony but grew quieter by morning, passing away at eleven o'clock.
