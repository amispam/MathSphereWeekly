                    On January 7, 1734, Euler married Katharina Gsell, the Swiss-born daughter of a St. Petersburg Gymnasium painter. They had 13 children, though only five survived infancy. <span style="background-color: lightsalmon;">Euler noted that some of his greatest discoveries were made while holding a baby, surrounded by his playing children.</span>

        <h4>Euler Reflects on Johann Bernoulli's Mentorship</h4>

            "if I [Euler] came across some obstacle or difficulty, I was given permission to visit him [Bernoulli] freely every Sunday afternoon and he kindly explained to me everything I could not understand ..."

        <h4>Euler's Triumph Over Blindness</h4>
        <div class="quote">
            In 1771, a cataract operation briefly restored Euler's sight, but neglecting proper care led to total blindness. Despite this, his extraordinary memory enabled him to continue groundbreaking work in optics, algebra, and lunar motion. Remarkably, after returning to St. Petersburg at age 59, he produced nearly half of his life's work while completely blind.
