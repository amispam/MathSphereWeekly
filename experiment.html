        <li>Parameters of the experiment are scheduled for January 04, 2025.</li>
        <li>Ideal time to conduct the experiment to minimize the error: 11:55 AM</li>
        <li>Duration of Experiment: 05 Minutes.</li>
    </ol>
     <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1: Know your location:</b> The location of Sunbeam School, Cholapur, is approximately 25 degrees 30 minutes North latitude and 83 degrees 00 minutes East longitude. In short <b>25.5, 83.0</b> on Google Maps.

        </li>
        <li><b>Step 2: Find the desired location on Earth:</b> Using the Stellarium app, determine the latitude on Earth where the sun is directly overhead at the time of your experiment. 
        <img src="im2.jpeg" alt="">
        <ol type="a">
            <li>To do this, open the Stellarium app, click on Settings > Location. Now, in place of latitude, feed 25 degrees 30 minutes, and in place of longitude, feed 83 degrees 0 minutes. This is your current approximate location.</li>
            <li>You cannot change longitude (doing so will result in serious consequences). Now, keep changing the latitude position until you find the sun straight above your head. Note down the latitude and longitude position in your diary when the sun is directly overhead. Here is a screenshot for your reference.

            </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 3: Feed the location you got in Step 2 from the Stellarium app into Google Maps.</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Note: In Stellarium, if latitude is in the south, feed the negative of the latitude into Google Maps. For example, if your latitude is x degrees 0 minutes south in Stellarium, in Google Maps, you should feed -x.0, 83.0. (Remember, you did not change longitude, so it will remain 83). Here is a screenshot for your reference.
            <img src="im8.jpeg" alt="">
            <li>
                Now, in Google Maps, click on "Measure Distance" and measure the distance of this location from your current location. 
                <img src="im9.jpeg" alt=""><br />
                This is the distance between your current location and a point on Earth where the sun is straight above your head. This distance will act as the length of the arc.<br />
                <img src="im5.jpeg" alt="">
            </li>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 4: Measure the angle between the sun rays and an upright object:</b>
            <img src="im6.jpeg" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 5: Time to find the circumference of Earth:</b>
            You know the arc length and the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the Earth. Now, what are you waiting for?
        </li>
     </ul>

     <b>IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE ANY APP, THEN YOU HAVE TO WALK AND SWIM HUNDREDS OF KM TO REACH THAT LOCATION WHERE THE SUN IS STRAIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD!!!! I AM NOT GOING TO STOP YOU, GO WALK AND SWIM.</b>
